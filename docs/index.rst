Welcome to ForteModel's documentation!
======================================

**ForteModel** is a repository for simulation scripts created with the Geant4 
Application for Tomographic Emission (GATE) to be used with a model of the
Phillips/ADAC Forte dual headed positron camera.

GATE is a Monte Carlo radiation transport and detector simulation software. A 
model of Forte detectior has been created using GATE and validated by experiments
a the University of Birmingham's Positron Imaging Centre. The objective of this 
repository is create a single place where simulation scripts can be catalogued, 
described, and made available to the public and other researchers.
